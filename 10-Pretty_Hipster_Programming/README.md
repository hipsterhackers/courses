# Pretty Hipster Programming

### Your first look into server-side programming with PHP

You've started looking into programming, but it's only been with JavaScript. JavaScript is a client side programming language, but now it's time to dive into a server side language. We will be doing our first intro to PHP. From installation to your first program.

## Lecture

**HPP?**

PHP stands for hypertext pre-processor. I guess if you turned that into an acronym it would be HPP, but that would probably have been confusing because of the HP computers that were so popular in the 90's when the language came out. The other more likely issue would have been confusing HPP with CPP (c++) which is another programming language that had header files that ended in `.hpp`. We can't have people getting confused by the file extension, so `.php` it is.

PHP is indeed a programming language. Unlike JavaScript though, PHP is a server side programming language. This means that the code will only run on the machine that it lives on. This is good because this is usually were you would write your "secret sauce" that makes your application a multi-billion dollar one.

**Server side Programming**

When I say "server-side", I want to clarify what that means exactly. In a very overly simplified example, let's use Facebook. Facebook just so happens to be written (partially) in PHP. In this example, we'll say Facebook has 1 server, and 1 user (you). When you visit facebook.com, your computer connects the the Facebook computer, and then the Facbeook computer sends the data to be displayed back to your computer. So we're dealing with 2 different computers here. The Facebook computer (server side), and your computer (client side). Anything that requires your computer to do the thinking is being run on the client side, and anything that requires the Facebook computer to do thinking (like getting a list of your friends, etc...) is being done on the server side.

Clear as mud? :thumbsup:

### Installing PHP

Ok, we need to get this bad boy installed on your machine, but it may be a bit tricky. First, pick your operating system.

**Windows**

1. Easiest option is to install [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/).

NOTE: you may get an error `msvcr110.dll is missing`. If this is the case, then you need to install the "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable library".

* [Windows7,8](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679#)
* [Windows Vista](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555)
* [Windows XP](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3387)

**OS X**

* For OSX 10.7 or later, you already have a later version of PHP installed. No need to do anything.
* Optionally, you can install additional tools with [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/)


**Linux**

Congrats you already have the "L" in [LAMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29)

[Good luck](http://php.net/manual/en/install.unix.php)


### Your first PHP app

Now that you have it installed and stuff, let's write a quick app to test it all out.

* Create a directory called `phpapptest`
* Open your terminal and `cd` into that directory
